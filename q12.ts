//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
//should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
//let Namesof_Friend : string[] = ["Inaya","Safa","Huda"];
//for (let name of Namesof_Friends){
//console.log(`"Hello ${name}, you like to learn typescript?"`)};
var  Nof: string[] = ["MAYA", "HAYA"];
for ( let i = 0; i< Nof.length; i++){
    console.log (`${Nof[i]} "Would you like to learn typscript today"`);
}
