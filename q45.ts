//45.	Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
 
function make_car(manufacturer:string , model:string, ...options:[string, any][]):Object  {

  let car = {
    manufacturer,model
  };
  options.forEach(([key,value]) => car [key]=value);
    
  return car;
}
  console.log(make_car("toyota","corolla",["color","black"],["year","2018"]));
  console.log(make_car("cahangan","elsvin",["color","white"],["year","2020"]));
